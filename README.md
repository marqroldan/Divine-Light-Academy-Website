A complete redesign of Divine Light Academy's website found at dla.edu.ph.

It is a single-page application that uses Google Services such as Sheets and Calendar to host some of dynamic data.

Created this for the purpose of showcasing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript proficiency. It is coded using pure JavaScript and also with SASS to improve styling speed.

Here were the problems that I had wanted to solve:
- Having a catchy and responsive design.
- Having dynamic data without requiring a database or servers to host the page and data.
- Having some of the information available externally.

To solve these problems: 
- I had to come up with a palette that would complement the logo while also giving off the 'divine' feeling. I've decided to use an orange-to-yellow gradient. 
- Used Google Sheets to host some of the dynamic data and also to organize them to their respective groups.
- The spreadsheet file can be publicly viewed but not edited. Schedule of events were based on Google Calendar for ease of sharing and syncing of events across all subscribed devices.

I would like to note that I do not have any professional or educational background when it comes to designing, but I did it anyways which actually took a great amount of time of the project's cycle.
